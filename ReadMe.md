# JelloScript Game Engine

JelloScript started out as a hobby, but later became thesis project.

## Getting Started

To use JelloScript currently you have to **fork** this repo. Later on I want to bundle it into a single `.js` file for easier use.

For starters, you should check out the [Quick Start] guide on the github wiki

## Contributing

I really appreciate the thought, however I don't accept any contributions **yet**. Once I'm finished with my thesis I'll gladly turn the project into open-source. Expect this to be around summer this year.
